        <h2>Welcome to the finance tracker!</h2>

        <p>
            This finance tracker is to help you track your expenses and budget during the
            college years. As we know the budget is limited but there are so many ways to 
            spend money. Here you will be able to keep track of your expenses so you don't
            accidentally overspend.
        </p>
